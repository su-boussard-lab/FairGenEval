Description: This package validates the fairness, bias, and generalizability of an ML model 
    that has been performed in multiple OMOP CDM databases.
    This package uses the OHDSI PLP model's external and interval validation results
    to calculate model performance across various population subgroups such as 
    race, ethnicity, gender, Charlson comorbidity severity groups, 
    and any defined vulnerable and risky groups.
